# Contributing

Hello and thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŽ‰

The main repository for this project is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/G-Research/tdigest-rs).

Please note that while we do accept contributions, this library is primarily built and maintained to serve the needs of G-Research, and our main priorities are to ensure that it continues to do so. This library is provided in the hope that it will be useful to others, however we consider the project complete to our needs and do not anticipate any meaningful feature development.

In practice, this means that we are more likely to accept correctness fixes and documentation updates, but we may be more conservative about accepting new features, and we can't promise to take every contribution. If you have encountered an issue which we ourselves do not encounter, we may or may not choose to fix it. For such problems, we are much more likely to review and accept a pull request that proposes a fix, than to create a fix from scratch.

We will try to address issues and review incoming pull requests, but we do so on a [best-effort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-effort_delivery) basis.

## Issues

Please raise bug reports and feature requests as Issues on [the GitHub project](https://github.com/G-Research/tdigest-rs/issues).

## Pull requests

Before embarking on a large change, we strongly recommend checking via a GitHub Issue first that we are likely to accept it.

You may find that the following guidelines will help you produce a change that we accept:

* Keep your change as small and focused as is practical.
* Ensure that your change is thoroughly tested.
* Document any choices you make which are not immediately obvious.
* Explain why your change is necessary or desirable.
